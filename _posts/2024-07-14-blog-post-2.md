Problem: [Count Arithmetic Subsequences](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc362/tasks/abc362_e)
In this problem,\
we are asked to find for each $K = 1, 2, \ldots, N$ , the number (mod $998244353$) of subsequences of $A$\
of length $K$ that are arithmetic sequences.\
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the differences between\
every two consecutive terms is the same. An important thing to notice here is\
that $1 \leq N \leq 80$
